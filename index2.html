        <h1>FAVOURITE GOD</h1>
        <img id="pp" src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Pictures\murugan.jpg"width="200px" height="150px">
        <p id="god">My favorite god is Lord Murugar, also known as Kartikeya or Subramanya. He is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, and is revered as the god of war, wisdom, and victory. I admire Him for His courage, youthful energy, and divine grace. Murugar rides a peacock and carries a powerful spear called the Vel, which symbolizes the destruction of ignorance and evil. He is worshipped in six sacred temples known as Arupadai Veedu, each representing a significant event in His divine journey. I feel spiritually connected to Him, especially when I chant “Om Saravanabhava,” which brings peace and strength to my heart. His festivals, like Thaipusam, are filled with devotion and vibrant celebrations. Lord Murugar inspires me to be brave, disciplined, and righteous. He is not just a deity to me—He is a guide, a protector, and a source of endless blessings in my life.</p>

        <img id="qq"src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Pictures\ladakh.jpg"width="200px"height="150px">
        <P id="place">My favorite place is Ladakh, a breathtaking region nestled in the Himalayas. Known for its stunning landscapes, Ladakh offers a unique blend of natural beauty, adventure, and spirituality. The snow-capped mountains, crystal-clear lakes like Pangong and Tso Moriri, and vast deserts create a magical atmosphere that captivates every traveler. I love the peaceful vibe of the monasteries, especially Hemis and Thiksey, which reflect the rich Buddhist culture of the region. The people of Ladakh are warm and welcoming, and their traditions are deeply rooted in harmony with nature. Whether it's trekking through rugged terrain, riding along the scenic roads, or simply gazing at the star-filled sky, every moment in Ladakh feels unforgettable. The fresh air, silence, and serenity make it a perfect escape from the chaos of daily life. For me, Ladakh is not just a destination—it’s a place of peace, adventure, and spiritual connection.</P>

        <h1>FOOD</h1>
        <img id="rr"src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Pictures\chettinad-chicken.jpg"width="200px" heigth="150px">
        <p id="food">My favorite food is chicken gravy, a dish that never fails to satisfy my taste buds. The rich, aromatic blend of spices combined with tender chicken pieces creates a mouthwatering experience that I absolutely love. Whether it's served with steamed rice, chapati, or dosa, chicken gravy adds a burst of flavor that makes every meal special. I enjoy the way the gravy is slow-cooked, allowing the spices to infuse deeply into the chicken, making it juicy and flavorful. The warmth of ginger, garlic, and garam masala gives it a comforting taste that reminds me of home-cooked meals. Sometimes, I like it spicy, with a touch of chili and pepper, and other times I prefer a milder version with coconut milk or curd. No matter the variation, chicken gravy remains my go-to dish. It’s not just food—it’s a feeling of comfort, celebration, and pure indulgence on a plate.</p>
